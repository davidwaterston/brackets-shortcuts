## [1.2.0] - 2015-06-19

### Changed
- Replace the hardcoded 'semver' version badge at the top of the README.md with a dynamic version which picks up the version from GitHub. No more forgetting to update the badge on a new release.


## [1.1.0] - 2015-06-28

### Added
- Add an 'In Progress' badge to the top of the README.md. This links to the project for the repo that is now being maintained in [Waffle](https://waffle.io/davidwaterston/brackets-shortcuts). 'In Progress' refers to the number of issues currently being worked on.
- Add the brackets-shortcuts.apkg file. This is the shortcuts in [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) binary format.
- Add a link in the 'Ready Mades' section of the README.md to the public flashcards in [Anki](http://ankisrs.net) for those that would rather not download the binary file from here.
- Add 'Future Plans' section to the end of the README.md. This links to the project for the repo that is now being maintained in [Waffle](https://waffle.io/davidwaterston/brackets-shortcuts).

### Changed
- Replace HTML-based badge links in README.md with their Markdown equivalents. This means the links will no longer open in a new window/tab.


## [1.0.0] - 2015-05-13

### Added
- Initial release.
